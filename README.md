## Description
This project uses the command line interface  to generate info cards for team members of a project. You can choose three types of employees: manager, engineer and intern. You can then enter information for each employee including information that is specific to their role in the project.

## Installation 
clone from github

## Usage 
Enter the command "node app" in the command line while in the Develop directory. You will receive a prompt asking if you would like to add an employee. If you select yes you will be prompted to select their role. You will then receive a series of prompts requesting input which will be used to fill out their information. After you have completed the prompts for an employee you will receive another prompt asking if you would like to add an employee. Select yes to add another and repeat the steps, or select no to end the program and render your employee information to final.html. If you open final.html in your browser at this point you will have info cards for all the employees you entered information for.
